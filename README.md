# resources

A place to make it easy to reuse the cool stuff we learn. Each resource is a labelled issue:

* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/resources/issues/new).

## Closing issues

In this repo most issues stay open. Given the goal of this repo, we only close an issue if the resource it exposes is no longer useful, e.g. because it became invalid, confusing or obsolete.
